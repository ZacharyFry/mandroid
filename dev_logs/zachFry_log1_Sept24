Up to now braistormed with group and came up with the idea for a bullet hell style game and a space version of Plants VS Zombies. Ideas were merged and the final concept was a more resource bassed version of the bullet hell idea. 

Yesterday started the writeup of the proposal as a group. Finalized writeup today with the help of Hayden and submited to CULearn. Also posted a copy to slack to give other member an opportunity to make changes and resubbmit if they found it needed changes.
