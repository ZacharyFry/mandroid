This week, I worked on completing the most important Unity tutorials for the project implementation, which
includes:

- Interface and Essantials
- Scripting (This includes learning basic and advanced features of the C# Language, as well as feautres exclusive to Unity)
- 2D Game creation
- Physics

Also I worked on tutorials on how to make example 2D Games using all the features mentioned above

Team:

As a team we agreed to build basic versions of our project individually using the design we want to propose next week
to the rest of the team

The best design will be used as a starting point and the whole team will work on improving it with more ideas (development will be underway by
that point)
