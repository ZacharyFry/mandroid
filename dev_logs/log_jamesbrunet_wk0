This log was done retroactively on week 1. 

This week, my wonderful idea for an app (redditSMS) was defeated. We then decided as a group to make a game. 
One idea we ended up not going with was a tower defense game where the player controlled the enemy and the ai controlled the tower placement. 

Over the course of two meetings we narrowed our idea from game --> 2d space game --> running on fumes (what we ended up proposing)
