Game Proposal:

- This week I proposed an idea for a space themed game that had RPG and turn based planning stage gameplay. This idea was rejected for a new game concept
  that shared the same theme, but featured real time gameplay and a simpler but more elegant user interface. Details of my original proposal can be
  found in the proposal folder of this repository under the name "Space_RPG_Game_Proposal".

Team Contributions:

- For the new game idea "Running on fumes", I proposed the idea of including in-stage pickup items that can be collected by the ship, while
  including an element of skill due to gravity and other environmental hazards.
  
- Helped with the overall design of the features for the "running on fumes" game, by discussing with the rest of the group which of our
  ideas where good for the game, which ones where bad and which ones did not work favorably for the gameplay of the product. This ultimately
  let to a more fleshed out set of requirements for the proposal.
  
- Helped discussing the feasibility of some of our feature ideas, according to the development cycle time before future iterations are due.

- Participated in the discussion leading to the decision of using Android as our development platform
