

Week 0 : We discussed possible projects that could be completed. The proposals that I contributed were: 
	Tapp: An app that checks what's on tap at bars located near you.
	An app that quickly instructs the user how to perform CPR and other basic emergency manouvers. 

Week 1: We further discussed what app we would be making, the bullet-hell idea eventually gained the most votes, and it quickly turned into a two dimensional physics puzzle app.
	We then discussed features that would be implemented and started to write our deliverable. This was mostly done as a group.

October 7th: We Made it a goal to all download Unity. Complete a few tutorials to have a good basic understanding of the type of technical setting this project would cover. 
                     Afterwords we discussed that we would pick the best of each of our starting projects to continue working on.
